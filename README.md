# Gabriel Furtado ‍
## Brazilian Coder at UNIVASF  🇧🇷
I'm Gabriel, a passionate 20-year-old computer science student fueled by coffee ☕ and the thrill of creating things with code <i class="fas fa-code"></i>.  Hailing from Brazil 🇧🇷, I'm currently sharpening my skills at the Federal University of São Francisco Valley (UNIVASF).
## My Digital Playground ️
* **Windows 11 & Arch Linux:**  I enjoy exploring the diverse landscapes of operating systems. My custom-built desktop <i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> is my powerhouse for demanding tasks, while my trusty laptop <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> keeps me productive on the go!
* **Coding Languages:**  I'm building a versatile skillset, currently working with C, Java, HTML, PHP, and CSS. Whether it's crafting robust applications or designing sleek user interfaces, I'm always eager to learn more.
* **Creative Toolkit:**  When I'm not coding, I unleash my artistic side with tools like Visual Studio Code (of course, for coding too! ) <i class="fas fa-code"></i>, GIMP and Inkscape for image manipulation, and Krita for digital painting <i class="fas fa-palette"></i>.
## Always Evolving 
I'm a lifelong learner, constantly seeking new challenges to push my boundaries and expand my knowledge base.
